### What I Do

I spend most of my time in backend web development with [FastAPI] (Python). I also maintain a couple open source projectssuch as [openapi-python-client] and [Dobby].

In my free time, I also blog about various topics that interest me on [my personal website][website]. Right now that's mostly about trying to find and/or create a web API framework as nice as [FastAPI] using Rust.

My main languages are Python 🐍 and Rust 🦀 but I also dabble in Kotlin and TypeScript.

### What I Like

🥰 I'm big on improving developer productivity, which is the theme of my open source work. That's also why I push for CI/CD, static analysis, and automatic formatting in my work.

🧐 Quality is core to everything I do. I want little more than for all the software in the world to be better, faster, and less frustrating to users. That's why I moved our team to use Python Type Annotations (with mypy), TypeScript (instead of JavaScript), and now Rust wherever feasible. Quality also includes things like:
- Security 🔒
- Testing 🧪
- Monitoring 🪵
- Documentation 📜

🤓 Learning! I'm always looking to learn new things, and love getting feedback and recommendations!

💜 The most important thing to me is being kind. I will look for any opportunity to foster a more welcoming community and eliminate hostile environments. The only thing intolerable is intolerance itself.
