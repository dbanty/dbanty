### What I Do

I'm the Lead Software Engineer at [Triax Technologies][triax] which basically means I steer the architecture and platforms of our software stacks. I spend most of my time working in Python (usually [FastAPI]) on the back end building serverless APIs for consumption by our IoT devices and UIs. I also maintain the open source projects that spawn from that work such as [openapi-python-client], [Dobby], [flex-config].

In my free time, I also blog about various topics that interest me on [my personal website][website]. Right now that's mostly about trying to find and/or create a web API framework as nice as [FastAPI] using Rust.

### What I Like

🥰 I'm big on improving developer productivity, which is why I created [openapi-python-client] and [flex-config] to speed up our internal work. That's also why I introduced CI/CD, static analysis, automatic formatting, and Kanban workflows to my team.

🧐 Quality is core to everything I do. I want little more than for all the software in the world to be better, faster, and less frustrating to users. That's why I moved our team to use Python Type Annotations (with mypy), TypeScript (instead of JavaScript), and now Rust wherever feasible. Quality also includes things like:
- Security 🔒
- Testing 🧪
- Monitoring 🪵
- Documentation 📜

🤓 Learning! I'm always looking to learn new things, and love getting feedback and recommendations!

💜 The most important thing to me is being kind. I will look for any opportunity to foster a more welcoming community and eliminate hostile environments. The only thing intolerable is intolerance itself.
